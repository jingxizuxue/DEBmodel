# Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) Model

## Introduction

The Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory provides a comprehensive and quantitative framework for animal metabolism. DEB models describe how organisms allocate energy for growth, reproduction, and maintenance based on simple rules derived from fundamental principles. This repository contains the implementation of a DEB model that can be applied to various species under different environmental conditions.

## Features

- **General applicability**: Can be tailored to any aquatic or terrestrial species.
- **Flexibility**: Accommodates different feeding strategies and life histories.
- **Predictive power**: Useful for predicting growth rates, lifespan, and reproduction.

## Installation

To use this DEB model, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

\```bash
git clone https://github.com/jingxizuxue/DEBmodel.git
cd DEBmodel
pip install -r requirements.txt
\```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to run a simulation using the DEB model:

\```python
from deb_model import DEB

# Initialize the model with species-specific parameters
deb = DEB(species_params)

# Run the model over a specified timespan
results = deb.simulate(timespan)
\```
