# Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) Model

## Introduction

The Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory provides a comprehensive and quantitative framework for animal metabolism. DEB models describe how organisms allocate energy for growth, reproduction, and maintenance based on simple rules derived from fundamental principles. This repository contains the implementation of a DEB model that can be applied to various species under different environmental conditions.
